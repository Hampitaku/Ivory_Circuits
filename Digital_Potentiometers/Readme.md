This is the repository for the project that showcases the use and application of the digital potentiometers that we recently have coded and been having fun with.

This project is based on a Teensy 3.2 clocked at 120 MHz with a 2.54 OLED screen from DiyMore. It basically controls the three potentiometers through a rotary encoder and a push button. The serial port displays useful information regarding the status of the sensors while the OLED screen shos the selected device and respective value (aproximated) current tap value and the selected channel from the TPL0102.

The _DigiPots-Showcase_ folder is a VSCode + platformio project container that improves the workflow and coding experience. Copy the two library folders to the _lib_ folder and verify that your dependencies are met.

This is how the breadboard with this prototype looks like:
